            Hello there! My name is Cameron and I'm in my 5th year of my computing science degree at the University of Alberta. I spend most of my time keeping up on assignments and helping manage NeurAlbertaTech, but when I get some free time on my hands I really enjoy photography. I'm a real sucker for pretty coloured skies, be it sunsets, stars, or the auroras!

            <h2>NeurAlbertaTech</h2>
            <h3>Chief Technology Officer / President</h3>
            <h3>Feb 2019 - Now</h3>
            <p>
              I co-founded NeurAlbertaTech back in 2019 to compete in an international neurotechnology competition with a couple other interested individuals. It has since rapidly grown into a non-profit organization with the purpose of improving the general accessibility of neurotechnology through means of education, hardware borrowing, and familiarizing.
              <br><br>
              I've held many roles with NAT, but currently I am the Chief Technology Officer for the non-profit organization and the president of the University of Alberta chapter of NAT.

              Using web frameworks I worked with the team to develop cryptocurrency ATM software deployed across Canada. I also spent several months helping design and build the framework for an online cryptocurrency exchange platform, leveraging creative ways to streamline the process of purchasing crypto online.

          I am almost always excited to be doing what I do and I really enjoy working with others! Nothing brings me quite as much joy as finally getting the CSS working on all web browsers and across all reasonable screen shapes.
